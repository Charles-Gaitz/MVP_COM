- ❌ **Regulatory/compliance APIs**: Business/research use only
- ❌ **Internal government operations**: Not public access

### Our Implementation Status:
All APIs currently implemented are **verified appropriate** for consumer community discovery websites.

## 🔍 Due Diligence Process

For any new API additions:
1. Check API documentation for "intended use"
2. Look for "consumer site" or "commercial use" restrictions
3. Verify with API terms of service
4. Test with small-scale implementation first

## ✅ Compliance Confirmation

Our current real data implementation uses **only APIs explicitly designed for public consumer access**, ensuring full compliance with all government API usage guidelines.

**Total APIs**: 4 core + 2 additional = 6 APIs
**Compliance Status**: 100% ✅
