The $75 million transit initiative will include dedicated bus lanes, modern transit stations, and electric buses to provide reliable, environmentally-friendly transportation options for residents.

"This transit system will transform how our residents move throughout the region," said Katy Mayor Dusty Thiele. "We're creating connections that will reduce traffic congestion while providing convenient access to jobs and services."

The first phase will include three main routes connecting Katy Mills Mall, the Katy Business District, and several major residential developments. Each route will feature 15-minute peak-hour service and real-time arrival information at all stations.

Construction is expected to begin in summer 2025, with the first routes becoming operational by early 2027. The project has received support from both state and federal transportation funding programs.`
